## 🎭 The naming convention

```
Brand name         = kebab-case, fun, memorable (e.g. "royal-rumble")
Real fund title    = yaml "role:" field in each SKILL.md frontmatter
                   = how this role is described on a LinkedIn or CV
```

**You keep the fun. Recruiters see the function.**

---

## 🎯 Usage examples

**Your LinkedIn summary:**
> "Built and operate Blue Hill Capital, a pre-alpha hedge fund, across a 13-role organizational chart: PM, Head of Research, Chief of Staff, Investment Committee (13 legends), IR/Press Office, Performance Attribution, Trader Diary, Events Desk, Due Diligence, Records Manager, Research Librarian, and Back Office. Each role is a versioned Claude skill. Stack runs $2.4k/year."

**Your interview opener:**
> "At Blue Hill, our Investment Committee runs every name through a sealed-subagent blind committee of 13 legendary investor frameworks. The Judge synthesizes a weighted verdict. Our Chief of Staff ranks the output for attention, and our Press Office turns it into Howard Marks-style memos. Every trade lives in git with audit trail."

## 📐 What to add when you create a new skill

```yaml

```

Then update this file (`ORG-CHART.md`) to add the row.

## 🃏 The deepest point

You didn't invent a fund org chart. You **rediscovered** it — because the problems a fund solves are universal (research, attention, memory, communication, ops). Your skill names are playful, but the underlying roles are 100 years old.

**Fun on the outside. Professional on the inside. The best of both.** 🏛️⚔️
